# aframe-sfhtml5-presentation

> A-Frame is a declarative WebVR framework for web developers. We'll introduce
the game-changing concepts of A-Frame, showcase what the community has built
with A-Frame in the last several months, and present sneak peeks of novel
experiments that we have rapidly prototyped using A-Frame.
